Personal Projects:
-	[Health Care](https://www.e-healthbd.com)
  > Health Care Service providing system. Users can search for doctors according to hospital, location, and specialty. Users can also book appointments, order medicine, and take diagnostic reports with ease.
-	[Pilot Payroll Management](https://www.crystalaironline.com)
  > Pilots have to perform varieties of duties like “on duty”, “off duty”, “charter flight”, “flight instruction”, “office work” etc. I had to create a dashboard where authority can add pilots and pilots can use their custom dashboard to enter different types of works along with time range. Finally, authority can generate payroll based on these inputs.
-	[Image Based Authentication System](http://beta.passnumber.com)
  > One of the most secured authentication systems that completely removes the threat of Key-Loggers, Man in the Middle Attack, and Shouldering Attack. Therefore, user can log in to       their accounts from any place. And the fun part is, even a three-year-old kid can create an un-hackable password.
